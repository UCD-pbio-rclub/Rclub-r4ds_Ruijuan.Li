24.2.2 
how he found there is nothing wrong in the price list? 

24.2.3 exercise 4
does the final model mod_diamonds2, do a good job of predicting diamond prices? Would you trust it to tell you how much to spend if you were buying a diamond? 

overall, it is better, based on the residual, but there are some diamonds with quite large residuals at the lower lcarat end where the model doesn't work well enough. 

make_date() 

wday()

24.3 "Our model fails to accurately predict the number of flights on Saturday: during summer there are more flights than we expect, and during Fall there are fewer. Weâ€™ll see how we can do better to capture this pattern in the next section." I actually see the model doesn't work well on several wdays (Fri, Wed...) 

24.3.2 seasonal Saturday effect 
my understanding is that adding term improved the model fit (reduced residual), but I don't see using rlm() function improved model fit. 

24.3.5
3. the model with just Saturday term performes worse than the model with all term. 
lower R squred, higher AIC
